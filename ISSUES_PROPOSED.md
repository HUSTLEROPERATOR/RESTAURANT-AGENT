Proposed starter issues to help restaurateurs

1) React frontend to visualize /api/dashboard/data (good first issue)
- Implement a simple React app that fetches latest invoices and shows a monthly chart.

2) CSV/Excel uploader + basic validator (good first issue)
- Endpoint to upload a CSV/XLSX, validate columns, and return anomalies.

3) Local embeddings demo for text search (easy/medium)
- Implement DummyEmbeddings and a small vector index to support text similarity without cloud keys.

4) Inventory REST API (medium)
- Create CRUD endpoints for inventory items, with unit tests and docs.

5) Simple forecasting (medium/hard)
- Implement a light-weight forecasting endpoint that uses moving averages to predict next month's spend.

6) Integrate sampling scheduled jobs (easy)
- Add a background task that periodically aggregates daily totals for the dashboard.

Each issue should include: acceptance criteria, small test, and suggested file locations.
